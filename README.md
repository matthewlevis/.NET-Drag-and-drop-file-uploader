# Visual Basic ASP.NET drag and drop file uploader
A simple HTML5 ASP.NET (VB) page that allows you to drag and drop a file into the browser to upload it to the server.

The code utilises the Javascript XMLHttpRequest object to POST the 'dropped' stream file to the VB page to be processed.

I've tried to simplify the code as much as possibly - hope this helps!
